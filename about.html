                As a Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in React.js,
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am currently expanding my skills to
                include backend development. I am learning how to fetch APIs and
                create API connections with MongoDB and backend technologies.
                While I excel at frontend tasks, I'm still gaining experience in
                backend development, exploring Node.js and other server-side
                tools. I seek opportunities to develop my backend skills,
                contribute to innovative projects, and grow as a full stack
                developer.

              <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
              <p>
                My journey into software development began with a fascination
                for technology and a desire to create. I started by learning
                basic web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This
                initial curiosity grew into a passion for frontend development,
                leading me to explore React.js and build interactive user
                interfaces.As I continued to develop my skills, I realized the
                importance of understanding backend technologies to create
                complete applications. This motivated me to start learning about
                APIs, Node.js, and MongoDB, which opened new doors for
                me.Throughout this journey, I found inspiration from online
                coding communities, personal projects, and supportive mentors
                who encouraged me to keep learning and growing. Today, I'm eager
                to continue building my expertise and applying my skills to
                real-world challenges.
